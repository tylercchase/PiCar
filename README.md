# PiCar  

**IN PROGRESS**

The intent of this project is to allow a basic head unit for a car that 
will enable a few key features such as:

 - Backup Camera  
 - OBD2 Reading  
 - Bluetooth audio controls

It is designed to run on a raspberry pi using a small touchscreen display as 
the interface and a webcam for the camera.

**WARNING**:  

This project isn't tested, This project isn't designed to add safety to your vehicle 
only convenience, just because it's a backup camera doesn't mean you don't have to 
look behind you.
